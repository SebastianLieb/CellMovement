1. System requirements:
-Operating system: Windows 10
-Dependencies: This sofware is stand-alone and has no dependencies

2. Installation guide:
-Unzip folder
-This should take around 1 minute on a "normal" desktop computer.

3. Demo
-Start the software (CellMovement 1.2/CellMovement.exe) and press the "Scenario 1" button to start simulating
-The simulation should show 84 cells at the bottom of a lightbulb shaped boundary. 
The cells should start migrating to fill the rest of the boundary. 
It should take around 8 minutes for the cells to fill the given boundary.
-The simulation should run with ~15-60 frames per second on a "normal" desktop computer
-The video "ExpectedOutputTimelapse.mp4" shows the expected simulation behaviour sped up ~30 times.
